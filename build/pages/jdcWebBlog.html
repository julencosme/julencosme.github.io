    <h1>Blogging of Varying Degrees:</h1>
    <h1>Code, Social Aspects of Health, and Archaeology of Ancient Egypt</h1>
    <h2>Code</h2>
    <p>
      Formulas. When I think about the array of disciplines in which formulas
      are handy &ndash; be it mathematics, lab work, herbal remedies, baking &ndash; I
      realize that they have always been my favorite part of learning. I love an
      opportunity to build a toolkit populated with formulas. Having a quick
      reference with no filler is one of the joys in life for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I like outlines. Dynamic, short, and concise equals a happy me. No matter
      the discipline, guaranteed, in short reach is a list of formulas &ndash; the
      essentials, void of complete sentences. The trick is saying more by
      writing less. Classes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Getting classes to check out properly is a task in itself. Initially, when
      I would create child classes for a parent class, I predominately focused
      on the parent class, so much that I wouldn’t allow myself to move on
      through the problem until all of my child classes fell in line. But I’ve
      come &ndash; firstly &ndash; to anticipate the instances that shall be called upon,
      once all that meticulous mapping and outlining have been carried out. It's
      a little like working backwards. But it has helped me. I think about
      potential instances first; I ponder how to build the parent class,
      along with its child classes, accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coding is new to me. It began as a hobby &ndash; a challenge in which I could
      lose myself for few hours. At first, I thought, "well this is nice: it is
      like approaching a new language." I am learning new syntax: this is fun!
      But the more involved I became, the more I realized that, perhaps, I am
      capable of more than merely memorizing the meaning of its punctuation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coding fulfills my need to be a problem solver. It has broadened the way I
      think. ABOUT EVERYTHING. Backwards mapping: I don’t use it enough. Or I
      never took the time to appreciate the beauty it serves &ndash; until
      writing classes.

      <h2>Social Aspects of Health</h2>
      <p>
        SOCIAL DETERMINANTS.
      </p>
      <p>
        Realizing that the general health of diverse populations is affected by
        income inequality moves one to consider social aspects that influence
        this phenomenon. Social determinants should be especially examined,
        because, despite what one might assume, the health of those on the
        high-income end of the spectrum are experiencing negative consequences,
        just as those on the low-income end of the spectrum are undergoing
        negative repercussions. Through analyzing concepts provided by Richard
        Wilkinson, John Lynch et al., and Dr. Donald Warne, the unfavorable
        health outcomes caused by income inequality are better understood.
      </p>
      <p>
        Competition, superiority, inferiority, and sense of distrust fill our
        society with stressors. Wilkinson illustrates that a wide gap between
        low-income populations and high-income populations creates an
        environment in which hostility ultimately affects health. He raises the
        point that when the gap between the poor and rich is larger, rates of
        homicides and individuals in prison increase dramatically (TED 2011). In
        addition, Lynch et al. offer similar insight into this idea of trust,
        violence, and health. Social cohesion dissipates when there is greater
        income inequality. This disintegration of social cohesion influences
        homicide and violence, particularly regarding young adults (Lynch et al.
        2004). Such a statistic raises more questions, comments, and, possibly,
        answers. Wilkinson presents notions on the relationship between status
        competition and psychological effects. Low-income groups may feel
        inferior in societies where the gap is wide. Evaluating oneself based on
        social value leads to stress (TED 2011). Stress compromises the immune
        system, subsequently causing entire groups of people to be constantly
        fighting off social and individual physical problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are aware that income inequality is detrimental to a population’s
        health, individually and as a whole. We are also aware that violence
        and distrust serve as culprits for declining health; but, why? And, are
        enough individuals voicing their opinion on an ugly, complex, and
        sensitive issue to make a difference for the vast populations suffering
        the consequences of great income inequality?
      </p>
      <p>
        Dr. Warne expresses his sincere opinion on matters of health, social
        aspects, and income inequality. In a web-exclusive video, "Bad Sugar:
        Episode 4 (Culture of Diabetes — Native Americans and Futurelessness),""
        Warne discusses the impact of income inequality and social isolation.
        Through practicing medicine and tending to the health of numerous Native
        American patients, he has come to believe that diabetes is an
        environmental and social behavioral matter. He states that diabetes was
        rare in Native American populations prior to the damming of rivers in
        Arizona  (Unnatural Causes 2008). In an early 1900s health survey, there
        was one documented case of diabetes. Diabetes has only dramatically
        increased since then (Unnatural Causes 2008). Warne conveys that people
        who have less access to good foods, in addition to the introduction of
        bad foods such as corn syrup, makes particular populations more prone to
        diseases like diabetes (Unnatural Causes 2008). Moreover, he expresses
        that due to the social isolation of Native Americans, diseases more
        easily plague their population, because a feeling of isolation leads to
        a feeling of hopelessness (Unnatural Causes 2008). Since Native
        Americans have experienced major shifts in lifestyle, they are also
        feeling disconnected with their cultural traditions, which only
        perpetuates this feeling of unhealthy isolation (Unnatural Causes 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
        Income inequality causes a social split that is detrimental to the
        health of all those involved. Even though low-income populations or
        culturally isolated populations have urged researchers to examine the
        cause and effect of widespread diseases, more research should be done on
        how income inequality is also affecting those in the high-income
        bracket. Social isolation could be applied to high-income groups in
        further investigations. The greater the divide, the greater the odds for
        opposition to implore a threat.

        CATS, MOLD: IN NEED OF A NEW HOME.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my own life experiences, and through evaluating reading materials and
        discussions with others, I have found that housing conditions (including
        indoor and outdoor pollution) prove to be a strong determinant of
        health. William C. Cockerham conveys that respiratory infection and
        problematic symptoms correlate with quality of housing conditions
        (Cockerham 2014). The poor quality of housing conditions of my last
        rental space negatively affected my health and the health of my pets. My
        relocation to a building with better indoor and outdoor conditions
        immediately improved some of my and my pets’ symptoms. Insulation,
        moisture, and ventilation all contribute to poor respiratory health
        (Cockerham 2014). Respiratory problems proved to be just the beginning
        of the issues ailing my cats and me. We certainly suffered symptoms,
        such as sneezing, wheezing, coughing, and chronic headaches. But
        perhaps more frightening was witnessing the dermatological journey of
        one of my cats in particular.</p>
      <p>
        Issues with mold and cockroaches tormented one of my cats &ndash;
        progressively depleting his fur to bare skin. His battle with these
        allergic reactions were consuming his life. By the time we moved away
        from the property, half of his body was furless. His constant itching
        and grooming was then supplemented by his persistent vocalization;
        almost as if he was veritably “crying for help”. Fortunately, we were
        able to move into a better insulated apartment with no mold and only the
        occasional cockroach within the next year.</p>
      <p>
        After only a few months of living in our new home, he had stopped the
        constant sneezing, scratching, and howling; his coat grew back in,
        beautifully, a month or so after that. He became an entirely different
        cat, a healthy cat. He plays much longer and is not as anxious. It moved
        me so much to see him not just healthy but happy again, that I almost
        forgot that I, too, was not suffering chronic headaches, inflamed sinuses,
        and swollen lymph nodes.

    <p>
      CONVENIENCE STORES AND LOW-INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS.
    </p>
    <p>
      The high quantity of low-quality foods pervading low-income neighborhoods
      is atrocious. In regards to food categories, most markets found in
      low-income neighborhoods can hardly be recognized as functional markets,
      but rather, as corner or convenience stores. What may be even more
      devastating is that the United States Department of Agriculture lists
      these convenience stores and liquor stores under the same classification
      as grocery stores such as Whole Foods (Ornelas 2012). Lauren Ornelas, of
      the organization Food is Power, Sam Dolnick, of the <em>New York
        Times,</em> and Jessica Y. Breland et al. in their study titled,
      “Challenges to Healthy Eating for People With Diabetes in a Low-Income,
      Minority Neighborhood,” all exhibit how access to particular food
      categories greatly determines the health of those particular communities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ornelas declares the irony in what has happened in Silicon Valley
      concerning food availability. Silicon Valley, historically, has been noted
      for its orchards. However, in a study conducted on Santa Clara County and
      access to healthy foods, fresh foods were found to not only be lacking in
      this region, but the foods that were made available to the community were
      food categories conducive to bad health and disease (Ornelas 2012).
      Ornelas is a strong advocate for choosing a vegan diet and would like to
      see more vegan options readily available for individuals living in
      low-income neighborhoods. Dolnick raises various points revolving around
      low-income neighborhoods and food availability. South Bronx and obesity
      has been an issue due to minimal options for healthy food choices (Dolnick
      2010). In addition, Breland et al. describe how diabetes has taken over
      minority and low-income populations. When comparing food categories such
      as fast food restaurants and highly processed foods to healthier eating
      choices like fresh produce, one can comprehend why diet-driven diseases
      permeate throughout populations of particular communities. Likewise, other
      various and important aspects of health and food access need to be
      addressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, not only does providing almost exclusively unhealthy food
      choices increase rates of disease such as diabetes, but some of the
      long-term consequences have to do with being unaware of which food
      categories are available and why. One needs to examine a person’s
      community in order to understand his or her overall health. Breland et al.
      found that two of the major impressions conveyed through their study was
      that the short-term, unfavorable consequences of diet eclipsed the
      long-term benefits of maintaining a healthy diet and that the
      communication between individuals and their healthcare providers
      concerning diabetes was ambiguous to a fault (Breland et al. 2013).
      Regardless of where one resides, teaching and learning together helps
      everyone as a whole to grow. The same is true for health and combating
      illness and disease. Those needing care, and those treating the ailing,
      should be aware of the tools and resources accessible to them. Clients and
      clinicians should establish a functioning system where each person
      involved has a good understanding of the various factors affecting their
      health, which includes options to better food choices, or questioning
      (together) why healthier options are not being offered by neighborhood
      establishments. The current generation can ingrain valuable, healthy
      behaviors or promote necessary actions to take in order to improve the
      quality of life for those in their community &ndash; ultimately,
      benefiting the lives of future generations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great thing about knowledge is that, oftentimes, even though it seems
      to initially ignite on an individual level, its true potential is seen as
      knowledge itself proliferates throughout a community. As families band
      together to encourage better health choices, and communities work together
      towards access to better foods, neighborhoods can combat illness, disease,
      and unfavorable circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ornelas targets focus groups in La Mesa Verde where communities are being
      taught how to grow food in their own yards. In addition, their
      organization offers health-conscious cooking classes (Ornelas 2012). These
      types of movements have the potential to create long-term change for these
      communities. A shift in the perception of convenience stores may be
      occurring. The average corner store is largely seeming more like a
      diet-driven-disease vending facility.

      <h2>Archaeology of Ancient Egypt</h2>
      <p>
        ARCHAEOLOGICAL PARADIGMS, POTTERY, AND ARTIFACTS.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pottery, as well as other artifacts and features, convey various
        concepts about past ancient peoples. Paradigms such as cultural history,
        processualism, and post-processualism are used by archaeologists to
        study and analyze remains. These paradigms help scientists to construct
        studies and answer questions like, what people were doing, what their
        environment may have been like, and what some of their beliefs systems
        were.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seriation and cross-dating are methods that draw upon elements from both
        a cultural historical approach and a processualist approach. If a
        particular ceramic style frequently found at one site is also found at
        another site, both sites could be considered contemporary to each other,
        which aides in dating the artifact. A scientist using a cultural
        historical approach compares characteristics of artifacts to each other.
        Here, the scientist will carefully analyze style, depiction, and
        materials. A processualist would also be concerned with how the
        materials were worked or used. Since seriation revolves around the idea
        that specific ceramics will increase in popularity and then decrease in
        popularity through time, it draws from both disciplines, because it
        takes into consideration what has been found and how frequently these
        artifacts occur (Brewer 2012). Post-processualism addresses the why
        questions pertaining to artifacts; it pays attention to particular art
        symbols depicted on the artifact. A post-processualist may also delve
        into questions about why women dominated more scenes on a particular
        object compared to men (Brewer 2012).
      </p>
      <p>
        Sociopolitical aspects of ancient cultures are also portrayed through
        examining artifacts. When Egypt transitioned into a more centralized
        economy, archaeologists were able to recognize this occurrence through
        observing an increase in mass produced wheels, molds, and pottery.
        Pottery before this transition differed in that it was highly detailed
        and more personalized in style. In addition, the economic centrality of
        this period is displayed by an overall increase of less decorative
        artifacts found distributed over a vaster region (Brewer 2012).
      </p>
      <p>
        Commercialization and exchange patterns among ancient cultures can be
        determined through analyzing pottery as well. The association of ancient
        Egyptians and Palestinians is evident through the discovery of
        Palestinian ceramic vessels, engineered in a similar manner by
        Egyptians. These particular vessels were produced with wavy handles.
        Striking similarities rendered in artifacts found in different regions
        supports the idea that different populations from different areas were
        most likely interacting with each other, and therefore, influencing each
        other (Brewer 2012).
      </p>
      <p>
        The archaeological record thrives on the use of diverse paradigms and
        methods by scientists. Documenting and assessing evidence from ancient
        societies leads current societies to answers concerning the past (and,
        possibly, the future). Artifacts represent human creation. What humans
        create often goes beyond necessity; it reveals various layers of the
        human experience, which include communication, self-expression, and
        interpretation.

      THE LATE PERIOD & PTOLEMAIC PERIOD: POLITICAL, RELIGIOUS, AND ECONOMIC
      MOTIVATIONS IN THE COMMISSIONING OF ART AND ARCHITECTURE.
    </p>
    <p>
      Royalty of the Late and Ptolemaic Periods commissioned art that was shaped
      by the political, religious, and economic climate. Featured in twenty-sixth
      dynasty art are past models, more specifically, styles of the Old, Middle,
      and New Kingdom (Robins 2008). Themes depicted in art represented
      religious deities such as Amun. Then, in later periods, other deities such
      as Nekhbet and Wadjit were chosen to be depicted. Even with shifts in
      rulership in the Late Period and Ptolemaic Period, like rebels
      overthrowing Persian kings and Persians reconquering Egypt, Egyptian art
      form, for the most part, successfully withstood the commotion and remained
      the historically dominant style as found in earlier periods.
    </p>
    <p>
      The twenty-sixth dynasty sunken relief of King Taharqa demonstrates a
      stylistic model reminiscent of the late fifth and early sixth dynasties.
      The figures have brawny limbs, low small of the back, and sizable shoulders
      (Robins 2008). Although the reasoning for incorporating older models into
      the art of this time has been disputed, Robins makes the insightful
      suggestion that Egyptians were now surrounded by Egyptian art of previous
      eras. Artists now had the ability to more easily study it and be inspired
      by it. Past religious ideas were not forgotten and were incorporated into
      the belief system of this time period.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since Amun symbolized the creator capable of rising above turmoil, King
      Taharqa (in the twenty-fifth dynasty) had a building constructed next to a
      sacred lake where rituals could be performed with the return of the Amun
      statue. The statue traveled to this temple from Medinet Habu (Robins
      2008). Nubian kings of the twenty-fifth dynasty insisted on expressing
      traditional Egyptian elements. Perhaps the emphasis of rebirth and
      regeneration for foreign kings and their people helped them to feel as
      though they were successfully melding into this culture and this new phase
      in their lives. In the periods to follow (the Late and Ptolemaic Periods),
      Egypt relied on Alexander the Great for assistance against Persian rule,
      which led to Ptolemy claiming himself as king. The descendants of Ptolemy
      had leadership over Egypt for two and a half centuries (Robins 2008). In
      the temple of Kom Ombo, two scenes exhibit King Ptolemy VIII being guided
      by Nekhbet and Wadjit to Sobek-Ra. Horus is shown giving the king Sed
      festival symbols. The layout of this relief is representative of Ptolemaic
      temple scenes, where each scene is encapsulated by a column of vertical
      text (Robins 2008). Decoration typical of the Ptolemaic Period
      predominantly expressed Egyptian style, which includes enhancing old
      traditions and refining skill. That art did not completely adopt foreign
      stylistic traditions, even though Egypt was being ruled by (ethnically)
      non-Egyptians, reveals the resiliency of Egyptian culture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Art has the ability to communicate history, and in more fortunate
      circumstances, can reveal abstract notions such as sentiment, atmosphere,
      and empathy. It is fortunate for ancient Egyptians that they were capable
      of this and so much more.
