					Good Afternoon:
				</p>
				<p>
					I have reviewed the software solutions you mentioned in your last email.
				</p>
				<p>
					All of the applications offer powerful features, such as marketing tools, integrated payment processing, and
					donor
					management. Knowing which features you deem most vital for The Center will help to determine if the investment
					is
					indeed worth it.
				</p>
				<p>
					I personally found the _______ CRM software to seem more user-friendly, which may be of importance to you and
					your case manager. I would strongly recommend, however, that you schedule a demo for you and your case manager
					to
					participate in. By viewing the demo, you will have a much clearer idea as to whether your investment in the
					application is the way to go.
				</p>
				<p>
					With that in mind, I would advise against applications that only offer a yearly subscription, especially if
					the
					company does not offer a free trial with adequate time to use the application and evaluate it. Some software
					solutions are buggy and do not show signs of this until you are inside the program.
				</p>
				<p>If you are searching for a software solution that offers marketing tools and streamlined payment processing,
					and
					with a focus on donor management, one of these applications would likely be beneficial.
				</p>
				<p>On the other hand, if you are more or less searching for an application that allows for ease in data input,
					organization of your data, and the ability to draw meaningful relationships from your data, something like
					_______
					would suffice. I hope these thoughts are useful. Feel free to communicate more of your thoughts and ideas on
					the
					matter.
				</p>
				<p>
					Kind Regards,
				</p>
				<p>
