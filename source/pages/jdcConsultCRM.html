        <h1>Offering advice to a small nonprofit. Director wished for a
            client data solution. All of their records were hand written at this
            point.</h1>
        <br></br>
        <p>
            Good Afternoon:<br></br>I have reviewed the software solutions you mentioned in your last email.
            <br></br>All of the applications offer powerful features, such as marketing tools, integrated payment
            processing, and donor
            management. Knowing which features you deem most vital for The Center will help to determine if the
            investment
            is indeed worth it.<br></br>I personally found the _______ CRM software to seem more user-friendly, which
            may be
            of importance to you and your case
            manager. I would strongly recommend, however, that you schedule a demo for you and your case manager to
            participate in.
            By viewing the demo, you will have a much clearer idea as to whether your investment in the application is
            the
            way to
            go.<br></br>With that in mind, I would advise against applications that only offer a yearly subscription,
            especially if the company
            does not offer a free trial with adequate time to use the application and evaluate it. Some software
            solutions
            are buggy
            and do not show signs of this until you are inside the program.<br></br>If you are searching for a software
            solution that offers marketing tools and streamlined payment processing, and with a
            focus on donor management, one of these applications would likely be beneficial.<br></br>On the other hand,
            if
            you are more or less searching for an application that allows for ease in data input, organization
            of your data, and the ability to draw meaningful relationships from your data, something like _______ would
            suffice.<br></br>I hope these thoughts are useful. Feel free to communicate more of your thoughts and ideas
            on
            the matter.<br></br>
            <br></br>
            Kind Regards,<br></br>Julen D. Cosme
