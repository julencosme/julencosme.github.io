  <p>I was born in Guam, raised in San Diego County, lived in New Orleans for the last ten years, and recently moved to Salt
Lake City.<br></br>I studied holistic medicine and herbal sciences in California, and earned my B.A. in Social Sciences, with an emphasis
in Anthropology, at Tulane University. While at Tulane, I also took a great interest in Evolutionary Biology and
  Ecology. And by great interest, I mean.... three years later I am still thinking
  about protists on a daily basis. <br></br>I cherish past occupations, which include teaching kids
  computer science skills such as coding and rudimentary robotics, working with developmentally disabled adults at The Magnolia School,
  and assisting various underserved communities. Such efforts include helping seniors to improve their computer skills at
  the Freret Neighborhood Center and teaching English to children in
  Honduras.<br></br>My more recent endeavors encompass developing in Python and
  exploring data science.<br></br>Throughout the years, however; my avocations
  have remained the same: singing, dancing, and painting.
