    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I was born in Guam, raised in San Diego County, for a time called New Orleans home, and am currently based out of
      Salt
      Lake City.
    </p>
    <p>
      I studied holistic medicine and herbal sciences in California, and earned my B.A. in Social
      Sciences, with an emphasis
      in Anthropology, at Tulane University. While at Tulane, I also took a great interest in Evolutionary Biology and
      Ecology. And by great interest, I mean....years later I am still thinking
      about protists on a daily basis.
    </p>

    <p>
      I cherish past occupations, which include teaching kids computer science skills such as coding and rudimentary
      robotics, working with developmentally disabled adults at Magnolia Community Services, and assisting various
      underserved
      communities. Such efforts include helping seniors to improve their computer skills at the Freret Neighborhood
      Center and teaching English to children in Honduras.
    </p>

    <p>
      My more recent endeavors encompass developing in Python and exploring data science.
    </p>

    <p>
      Throughout the years, however; my avocations have remained the same: dance, watercolor, oil and acrylic paint. And
      I sing.
