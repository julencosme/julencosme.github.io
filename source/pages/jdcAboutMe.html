<h1>About Me</h1>
<div>
  <p>I was born in Guam, raised in San Diego County, lived in New Orleans for the last ten years, and recently moved to
    Salt
    Lake City.<br></br>I studied holistic medicine and herbal sciences in California, and earned my B.A. in Social
    Sciences, with an emphasis
    in Anthropology, at Tulane University. While at Tulane, I also took a great interest in Evolutionary Biology and
    Ecology. And by great interest, I mean.... three years later I am still thinking
    about protists on a daily basis. <br></br>I cherish past occupations, which include teaching kids
    computer science skills such as coding and rudimentary robotics, working with developmentally disabled adults at The
    Magnolia School,
    and assisting various underserved communities. Such efforts include helping seniors to improve their computer skills
    at
    the Freret Neighborhood Center and teaching English to children in
    Honduras.<br></br>My more recent endeavors encompass developing in Python and
    exploring data science.<br></br>Throughout the years, however; my avocations
    have remained the same: singing, dancing, and painting.
